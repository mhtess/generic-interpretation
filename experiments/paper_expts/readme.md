## Experiment files

Each experiment is composed of an `.html` file and one or more `.js` files (located in the `js/` folder). The `css/` folder contains optional style files and the `shared/` folder contains shared infrastructural (experiment logic) code used by all experiments. These experiment files are based on the [`experiment_template`](https://github.com/erindb/experiment_template) developed by [Erin Bennett](https://github.com/erindb).

To run through an experiment, open the desired `.html` file in a browser (e.g., Chrome).
