# Interpretation experiments

## Interpretation-1

- 2/13/18
- 36 items (stims-2), all subjects rate all items
- $0.60
- n = 18 --> 10.8 + 2.16 = 12.96

## Interpretation-2

- 2/15/18
- 61 items (stims-3), subjects rate 36 items
- $0.60
- n = 36 --> 21.60 + 4.32 = 25.92

## Interpretation-3

- 2/21/18
- 72 items (stims-4), subjects rate 36 items
- low responses were asked a follow-up questions (explain)
- $0.60
- n = 36 --> 21.60 + 4.32 = 25.92

## Interpretation-4

- 3/17/18
- 74 items (stims-5), subjects rate 36 items
- n out of 100 question
- after memory check, low responses were asked a follow-up questions (explain)
- $0.80
- n = 36 --> 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56

## Interpretation-5

- 4/11/18
- preregistered
- 74 items (stims-5), subjects rate 36 items
- after memory check, low responses were asked a follow-up questions (explain) and can change response
- n out of 100 question
- $0.80
- n = 140 --> 112 + 22.4 = 134.4


## Interpretation-6

- 4/16/18
- replication using % question
- 75 items (stims-6), subjects rate 35 items
- after memory check, low responses were asked a follow-up questions (explain) and can change response
- $0.80
- n = 140 --> 112 + 22.4 = 134.4


# Prior experiments

## Prior-1

- 2/21/18
- 72 items (stims-4), subjects rate 12 items
- $0.60
- n = 36 --> 21.60 + 4.32 = 25.92

## Prior-2

- 3/17/18
- 74 items (stims-5), subjects rate 12 items
- $0.80
- n = 36 --> 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
+ n = 36 --> 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
+ n = 72 --> 69.12 (4/10/18)

# Manipulated prior experiments

## Prior-manipulation-1

- 4/13/18
- pilot, 6 distributions x {prior, listener}, 1 nonse verb (dax)
- $0.30
- n = 36 --> 10.8 + 2.16 = 12.96
+ n = 18 (only uniform) --> 6.48
+ n = 18 (pseudo-uniform, equal mixture weak or strong, only listener) --> 6.48
+ n = 18 (familiar properties) --> 6.48 (but paid 12.96)
+ n = 18 ("earthquakes", refactor cover story, forced waiting): weak_or_strong, weak_or_deterministic, uniform


## Prior-manipulation-1a
+ n = 36 ("earthquakes", refactor cover story, forced waiting): weak_or_strong, weak_or_deterministic, uniform


## Prior-manipulation-2

- 4/16/18
